alavue: Open Secure Distributed Remote Backup

This is a two part project:

1) Secure distributed remote file store: alavue.store
	a) The backup script to be run on a schedule with cron or as needed
	b) Encrypt and split all files individually inside a given directory or set of directories
	c) Store each slice with a different cloud storage provider

2) Complete emergency recovery with nothing more than your encryption key: alavue.recover
	a) The recovery script to be run in the event of partial or total loss of local storage
	b) Download all file slices from the cloud storage providers
	c) Stich the slices back together and unencrypt

Notes:
	- The cloud storage provider upload interface will be sftp where possible and implimented as vendor specific plugins otherwise
